# PartialOrder
This repository includes four algorithms used in the article, "Partial order relations for classification comparisons." "training.m" is the algorithm for learning a joint distribution for each of the five studies discussed in the paper. "Experiment1.m," "Experiment2.m," and "Experiment3.m" are the algorithms for experiment 1, experiment 2, and experiment 3 repectively in the paper.
